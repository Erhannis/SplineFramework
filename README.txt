Unity HTC Vive framework for making splines in VR.  Currently a little specific to making color splines, because that's what I want to do with it.
Contains VRTK, SteamVR, and "139 Vector Icons" by GDev.

Initialization:

1. Clone the SteamVR Unity Toolkit into the same parent directory as contains this project:

git clone https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK.git
cd VRTK
git checkout d49cebfa562740de54623fa4aa1b9d8ccc375614

2. Then, as administrator, run
